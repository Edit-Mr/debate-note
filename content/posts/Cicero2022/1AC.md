Good morning honorable judges and distinguished debaters. As the affirmative team, we believed the Taiwanese government should reinstate mandatory one-year military conscription.

I want to start by ranging the stakeholders. According to the "Act of Military Service System," males in Taiwan without disabilities or mental disorders who are eligible for physical examination Aged between 18~36 males should have the obligation to receive military service for one year. In addition, voluntary enlistment still exists.



## Contention 1: Military Internal Problems

### Military Strength

All soldiers should have patriotism if we want our army to be powerful. A report in the **Wall Street Journal on Oct. 2021 indicates** that the problem in Taiwan is that the few soldiers and low morale are urgent problems.

#### Insufficiency of soldiers

Although volunteer service exists, our army needs more soldiers. In a 4-month service period, soldiers only receive training for three months, and roughly 25,000 people are in the military each time. Compared with those in Korea, 330,000 people each year, the number of soldiers in Taiwan is insufficient.

One reason is the low birth rate. According to the analysis of the Legislative Yuan this year, there were about 153 thousand newborns last year, which is the sixth least in the world. Furthermore, the total number of soldiers will decline to 56 thousand in 2039.

#### The problems lying in current training

1. For mandatory soldiers, more than the training time is needed.
According to [Statista] (https://www.statista.com/chart/20418/most-powerful-militaries/),(<--不能用他的info graph來自global firepower) the US has the most potent military force. Next, go to Russia, then China. According to the US government, their military services vary, but most first enlistments are for 3 to 4 years. They use at least ten weeks to train in basic battle skills, proving that even powerful countries must train for a long time.
2. Training plans could be more [effective](https://www.nca.gov.tw/chaspx/News_Detail.aspx?web=83&id=6794).
Even if we have enough soldiers, our army can only defend itself if we have enough appropriate training. Our training cannot match the actual scenario. Generals, captains, and soldiers nowadays never have any experience in the real war.

### Actions speak louder than words

Patriotism should be turned into real action. We always say "Taiwan number 1". If we want to increase our patriotism, we must make ourselves strong. Furthermore, to increase our strength, we must extend our length of training. It does not just gain our arm forces to prevent crisis and project our home, but it also can increase our patriotism. 

#### Ｅxtending the length of military service can increase our patriotism

This phenomenon is similar to 'Stockholm Syndrome', which was proposed by Kuleshnyk __ in 1984. It happens when people know that it is impossible to escape, their freedom is restricted, and their sources of information are chronically limited. People will start to have recognition and empathy.

It is similar to our first day at school. Children cried to go back home on the first day. However, over time children started to adapt and love going to school.

## contention 2: armed Power

### [Armed power](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/ch/news/4279969)

We can improve the strength of the military. According to the "Five-Year Force Reconstruction and Policy Plan Report,2022" of the Ministry of National Defense, the Taiwan government bought MQ-9 "Reaper" from the USA, which can stay in the air for a long time, monitor and detect all day and night, and also has the striking ability. The army, navy, and air force also set up five remote control drone defense systems in the critical barracks. The navy indicates that they had promoted six Kang Ding-class frigate systems to improve the capability to defend air and anti-missile.

Also, war is no longer a brute force in this age of technology. Learning to operate these devices, such as robots or fighter jets, or making strategic judgments, is less important than physical fitness. No matter your fitness level, there is a place for you in the military. You can contribute any area of your expertise to help the nation.

Military service is not about making each person a soldier; it is excellent physical and mental training. Military service could help us increase our awareness of protecting our family and country. Also, military service makes soldiers braver, more confident, and more prepared.

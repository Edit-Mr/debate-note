Resolved: That the Taiwanese government should reinstate mandatory one-year military conscription.
:::

Good morning honorable judges and distinguished debaters. As the opposing team, the Taiwanese government shouldn't reinstate mandatory one-year military conscription. 

Before I start my debate, I have to admit that Taiwan is facing instability in the Indo-Pacific and a low birthrate. But I think extending military service to one year is a terrible idea, and the situation still has advantages. According to **a budget evaluation report of The Legislative Yuan**, the National Defense Ministry announced that there are 160 thousand soldiers voluntary military. And according to the Sea-Air Combat Power Improvement Plan Purchase Special Regulation, the government also buys various weapons such as Mobile Coastal Defense Cruise Missiles, Air Defense Artillery Systems, Land-Based Air Defense Systems, UAV Systems, Wan-Chien Air-to-Ground Missile Systems, HF IIE Missiles, High-Performance Naval Vessels, Equipping Coast Guard vessels with Wartime Weapon Systems.

Next, I will show you the downsides of one-year military service and our solutions to the problems that four-month military service creates.

## Contention 1: The invasion of the Island of Taiwan is brutal. 

### subpoint 1: Taiwan holds terrain advantages

> [Interview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtnpIK5mm0&ab_channel=%E5%BF%97%E7%A5%BA%E4%B8%83%E4%B8%83X%E5%9C%96%E6%96%87%E4%B8%8D%E7%AC%A6) | [Key point by EM](https://edit-mr.github.io/notes/posts/taiwan-strait-situation/)

According to an interview with 沈明室 by Simpleinfo, the director of national security claimed that it is traditionally considered in a sea crossing or amphibious landing to attack us, which is very hard. Because the landing operation consumes a lot from crossing the sea, ao usually, the strength of the landing side needs to be 6 to 10 times stronger than the defending side.

Because of the narrowness of the Taiwan Strait, the troops that China can accommodate are limited. There is no way for other countries to send more than 500,000 troops to the Taiwan Strait. If we divide the sea-crossing operations in the Taiwan Strait into different directions, there may be about 100,000 people in each order.

## Advantage

Even if the opponent does not necessarily use traditional landing operations, Taiwan is united internally, and we have sufficient training and reserve troops, so it is not easy for other countries to invade us.

When other countries are mobilizing, their nearby provinces and cities will have war mobilization (including materials, etc.), so we will soon notice that it is now ready for war mobilization. Then we can prepare early instead of being constantly tense.

### How can we win? (chicken soup)

Although China has 2 million troops, they cannot arrange all of them to Taiwan or our strait. It is at most 300,000 to 400,000. After separating in different directions, there are not many people. Presently, Taiwan has a population of 25 million, with at least 5 million young and robust workforce, at least 3 million in the reserve army, and of course, 3 million more in the Black Bear Academy.

It will have a significant deterrent effect if it can be organized and trained effectively, coupled with guerrilla warfare based on coastal towns or big cities.

#### Strategy

We can see from Ukraine's experience that in the first phase of the war, Ukraine was engaged in guerrilla warfare in cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv, so it won the battle in the first phase.

So if everyone realizes that Taiwan will use a protracted war to counter the CCP and cause China's military casualties to exceed 50,000 to 100,000, it will frustrate its follow-up operations and make it abandon its operations. Intention. Of course, it is essential to say that if it is a long-term war, it will consume a lot of workforces, but as long as we use flexible strategies and tactics, we can avoid fighting it head-on and let it fall into the quagmire of war. There is an excellent chance of winning this war.
As long as we are united, we will surely win the battle.

## Contention 2: Personal Interest | 個人利益

Truth be known, everyone in this world – including you and me - is selfish. Although we care about our country, if the same time can bring you more benefits than you can give the country, we would like to invest in you more.

> Everyone's selfish,證明個人利益比國家利益更重要，或著說同樣的時間能帶給自己的利益大於自己能給國家的利益(similar to投資回報率)
> * 可說國家建立在人民上，人民要能夠有足夠self-sufficiency再談為國家貢獻

### Influence career planning | 生涯規劃

Service life can hinder career development. By the time people reenter the workforce, competitors of the same age have had two years of work experience.

> 可以趁暑假時趕緊把兵役服完，這樣就不會打亂自己的規劃
> 因為兵役短，所以比較少發生有人為了"免役"而做出對自己身體有傷害的行為
### Economic losses | 經濟上的損失

Taiwan's population is not large, and most are elderly. According to the [latest demographic statistics provided by the Taiwan Ministry of the Interior](https://www.moi.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=2&s=11663), at the end of September 2022, 17.2 percent of Taiwan's population is elderly.

From the standpoint of ordinary people, young people are generally under significant economic pressure, and their salary is just enough to support their families. If the government insists on changing the service time to one year, the service will earn eight months less.

Even if the soldiers don't ask for their original salary level, according to Taiwan's basic labor bill, a person's minimum salary must be at least 20,000 under this premise. The government also has to pay a year's salary for soldiers, and it is a burden for the Taiwan government to give such a massive subsidy to those soldiers' families.

## Contention 3  Our training quality | 沒有適當的訓練系統

Our military training quality is relatively terrible than militarily essential countries. According to social media, we know that military training people are doing cleaning jobs instead of handling weapons.

As now the way we train soldiers, extending military service is to no avail. Even if it is changed to one year for national defense purposes, will we have a better chance of winning when the CCP decides to fight with us? Or we just run and admit that we lose Taiwan?

If we focus on "How long we have to train our soldiers, "we will lose our lands and lives. We should focus on "How strictly we should train our soldiers." Nowadays, Taiwan is facing a dangerous situation; soldiers should always be prepared to be at war.

> 根本問題是能力不足，而訓練不足的原因是沒辦法有效的利用訓練時間。比起盲目的延長兵役我們更應該要先重新規劃訓練。在完善的訓練計劃之下發現時間真的不夠之後才要延長兵役。

### regular recall

If we don't go to war, even if we extend military service to a year, soldiers also forget their training over time. Therefore, rather than prolonging the training time, regularly recruiting retired soldiers is the way to maintain the ability of soldiers.

## Contention 4 Government should pay more attention to weapons and supplies | 政府應該更加注重武器的質量與物資

Technology is quite advanced nowadays, using [weapons](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E4%B8%AD%E8%8F%AF%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B%E7%A9%BA%E8%BB%8D%E8%BB%8D%E5%82%99) would be the main point of winning the war. However, our military service extended to one year if those soldiers didn't learn the main lessons, and it doesn't mean anything to add eight months more. The most crucial part is that government should ensure all soldiers genuinely understand how to operate all weapons.

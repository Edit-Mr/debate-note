**Resolved: That the Taiwanese government shouldn’t reinstate mandatory one-year military conscription.**

Good morning honorable judges and distinguished debaters. As the opposing team, we think that the taiwanese government shouldn’t reinstate mandatory one-year military conscription. 

Before I start my debate, I have to admit that Taiwan is facing instability in the Indo-Pacific and the low birthrate.But I think extending military service to one year is a terrible idea. Next, I will show you the downsides of one-year military service and our solutions to the problems that four-month military service creates.


# **Contention 1:  Economic losses.(經濟上的損失）**

***

Taiwan's population is not large, and most are elderly.  According to the latest demographic statistics provided by Taiwan officials at the end of September 2022, 17.2 percent of Taiwan's population is elderly.
This is the information from Taiwan Ministry of the Interior.

From the stanpoint of ordinary people, young people are generally under great economic pressure, and their salary is just enough to support their families. If the government insist on changing the service time to one year, the service will earn 8 months less. 

Even if the soldiers don't ask for their original salary level,according to Taiwan's basic labor bill,a person's minimun salary must not be less than 20,000 under this premise.The government also has to pay a year's salary for soldiers. It is a burden for Taiwan goverment to give such a huge subsidy for those soldiers' familly.



# **Contention 2  Our training quality.(沒有適當的訓練系統)**

Obviously, our military training quality is relatively terrible than  militarily important countries. According to social media,we know that people in the military training are diong some cleaning job instead of handing-on weapons.

As now the way we train soldiers, extending military service is to no avail.Even if it is changed to one year for national defense purposes, will we have a better chance of winning when the CCP decide to fight with us? Or we just run and admit that we lose Taiwan?

If we just focus on "How long we have to train our soldiers", well, we obviously will lose our lands and our lives.We should focus on "How strict we shuold train our soldiers." Now days, Taiwan is facing a dangerous situation,soldiers should always be prepared to be on the war.


# Contention 3 Government should pay more attention to weapons.

Technology is quite advanced nowaday,use of the weapons would be the main point to win the war.Though our military service extended to one year,if those soldiers didn't learn the main lessons. It doesn't mean anything to add eight months more.We think the most important part is that government should make sure all of the soldiers truly understand how to operate all weapons. In addition,if the war didn't really occur,their one year training would be wasted. We think that government should maintain military service and should periodic recruit soldiers back for training.

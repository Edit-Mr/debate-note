## Bonus System

We will set up a bonus system to increase willingness. 

Increasing welfare will increase the willingness of citizens to join the military. And the benefits of volunteer service are better than the benefits of compulsory service...

> 具體講一個月給付多少錢

For example, we can increase the salary, 
And all soldier families can get half price on water and electricity bills and free tax.

### If the soldier has casualties in the war, how can we solve it？

We will pay the wounded soldiers' medical expenses and related accessories and employ professional psychological counselors to track the soldiers' mental health regularly.

Also, we will give consolation money to the families of deceased soldiers and hold funerals like state funerals. And set up an anniversary to remember these soldiers who died for the country.

> 查各國士兵待遇(如韓國)
> 做為參考進行比較，建議提高

## Training System

Many people do not want to join the army because the training is not arranged correctly. Many *people* complained that they spent more time in the office than training. Improved scheduling of training allows for good use of time.

### Every soldier can be wisely used

Talents are one of the most critical resources in war, and soldiers should be trained according to their talents. For example,  doctors can contribute their medical knowledge, and media creators can help with the witness war. 

A doctor can contribute his medical knowledge, and a media creator can inform the world about the current international situation. Those who are capable of language can help to contact foreigners. Extending the time of military service not only allows us to get complete training but also gives us a deeper understanding of our country.

*(Put below in QA)*

The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched the Alpha Dogfight project to allow humans and AI robots to conduct simulated air combat games. Compared with the current combat training of fighter jets, **virtual hostile fighters can significantly reduce the cost of air combat training.** In particular, it can simulate different scenarios, such as overseas threats, and join more extensive flight operations to help overcome many tactical challenges.

So we can cite from it to ... for ... long.
#### What's AR


### Send to a war zone & Exchange

We can send willing soldiers to battlefields and let them learn from experience.

### Stockholm Syndrome

Ｅxtending the length of military service can increase our patriotism. This phenomenon is similar to 'Stockholm Syndrome', which was proposed by Kuleshnyk __ in 1984. It happens when people know that it is impossible to escape, their freedom is restricted, and their sources of information are chronically limited. People will start to have recognition and empathy.

## Impact

* affecting people
* possibility of solving problems
* emotion - Love our families

### Teach their family

Although only men are currently obliged to do military service, they can teach their families how to fight or use weapons at home.

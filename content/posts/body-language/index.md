## What's this talk about

If you take a step back and look at all the boxes. Maybe there's a way to remove one or combine them so you can make that process much simpler.

We see the world more clearly when we see it for the first time. Before a lifetime of habits got in the way, our challenge was to get back there to feel that frustration, to see those little details to look broader, closer, and to think younger.

## Body language

### Normal

<img src="file:///C:/Users/VTEI/AppData/Roaming/marktext/images/2022-10-17-19-56-17-image.png" title="" alt="" width="227"><img src="file:///C:/Users/VTEI/AppData/Roaming/marktext/images/2022-10-17-20-19-48-image.png" title="" alt="" width="66">

Always feet shoulder-width apart. Hands above waist, or clenched and drooping naturally

Often putting a hand up. Like squeezing something. To highlight, or to show a pause.

### Emphasizing

I only list one of these times. Because they were added later

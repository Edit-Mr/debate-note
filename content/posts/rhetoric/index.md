### Assignment—Oh no! It’s a zombie apocalypse!

Please prepare your argument for your character and consider the following questions (write it down on your learning sheet):

> Your name and your given traits.Nothing outside the realm of normal for your characters given traits (but you can provide background and personality — just keep it reasonable).What are your strengths？What can you offer the new society?What are your weakness? How will you overcome those deficits?What makes a good “survivor”?Two rhetorical appeals (label and explain the intended effects).

### SOAPSTone

”SOAPSTONE” which Richard introduced is a fantastic writing strategy to use.

SOAPSTone stands for Speaker, Occasion, Audience, Purpose, Subject, Tone. Not really referring to that kind of stone

> 中文:演講者、場合、受眾、目的、主題和語氣

#### SPEAKER

STEP 1: DETERMINE THE SPEAKER. Identify who is telling the story or giving the information. Is it an omniscient narrator, a character in the story, or the actual author? Why do you think the author chose that person to be the speaker? What details about this person are important to know?

確定講者。確定誰在講故事或提供信息。它是無所不知的敘述者，故事中的人物，還是真正的作者？你認為作者為什麼選擇那個人作為講者？關於此人的哪些詳細信息很重要？

#### OCCASION

STEP 2: RECOGNIZE THE OCCASION. The occasion refers to the time and place of the story or written document. When and where do the events take place? From what geographical and chronological context is the speaker thinking and acting? How does the time and place affect and inform the text? What details are given about the occasion in the text itself?

> 識別場合。場合是指故事或書面文件的時間和地點。事件發生在何時何地？講者在什麼位置和年代背景下思考和行動？時間和地點如何影響文本的資訊？這個場合中文字給予了哪些細節？

#### AUDIENCE

STEP 3: DESCRIBE THE AUDIENCE. Consider the primary, secondary, and even tertiary audiences of this text. Who was the text written for? Why was it written for them? What characteristics do you know about the audience and how do you know that the text was written with them in mind?

> 描述受眾。考慮一下這本書的主要、次要甚至第三類讀者。文字是為誰寫的？為什麼是為他們寫的？您了解受眾的哪些特徵以及您如何知道文本是在考慮他們的情況下編寫的？

#### PURPOSE

STEP 4: ESTABLISH THE PURPOSE. Why would the author write this particular text for the audience you noted above? Determine the meaning and message underlying the prose and ask yourself: what value does this give to my audience? What does the author think or hope the audience of the text will think about the text or do as a result of it? How does the author effectively (or ineffectively) make his or her purpose clear and realize the purpose’s goals?

> 確立目標。為什麼作者要為你上面提到的觀眾寫這個特定的文本？確定文章背後的含義和信息，並問自己：這對我的聽眾有什麼價值？作者認為或希望文本的讀者會如何看待文本或因此而做的事情？作者如何有效地（或無效地）定位他或她的目標並實現它？

#### SUBJECT

STEP 5: INVESTIGATE THE SUBJECT. Knowing the audience and purpose of the document, in conjunction with the occasion and speaker allows you to better understand the subject or topic of the text. What is the author really getting at? What belies the story or prose, possibly providing a deeper meaning? What does the author reveal (or not reveal) when addressing the subject?

> 調查主題。了解文本的受眾和目的，結合場合和演講者，可以讓您更好地理解文本的主題或主題。作者的真正目的是什麼？是什麼掩蓋了故事或文本，可能提供更深層次的含義？作者在談到主題時透露（或不透露）什麼？

#### TONE

STEP 6: DISSECT THE TONE. Evaluate the word choice, organization, and rhetorical patterns in the prose. How do the textual elements make the audience feel? How does the author feel about the subject? Is the message heavy-handed, or is it subtle? What can you say about the syntactical construction and structure of the text in regards to tone?

> 分析語調。觀察文本中的單詞選擇、組織和修辭模式。文字元素如何讓觀眾感受到？作者如何看待這個主題？信息是嚴厲的，還是微妙的？關於語氣的文本的句法結構和結構，你有什麼想說的？

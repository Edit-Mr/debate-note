6. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on October 26 that Beijing believes that it will no longer accept the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and has begun to put pressure on Taipei, including not ruling out the possibility of using force. Beijing is determined to speed up the unification timetable, but he did not specify a date. The United States will not interfere in any way without affecting its own interests.
   
   > 美國國務卿布林肯（Antony Blinken）10月26日稱，北京認為不再接受台海現狀，並開始向台北方面施壓，當中包括不排除用武的可能。北京決心加快統一時間表，但他沒明確指出日期。美國在不影響自己利益之下不會進行任何干涉。

7. According to Akio Yaita's analysis, because China's internal affairs, international situation, and the leaders of the United States and China only spoke on the phone last week, it is unlikely that Beijing wants to start a cross-strait conflict at this stage. "This is a political show whose propaganda purpose is far greater than military purpose". "The current Chinese People's Liberation Army will not and will not dare to start a war in the Taiwan Strait."
   
   * **Domestic factors:** If there is an armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the Chinese army may be disadvantaged in its deployment, or it may fall into the quagmire of war. Even if we win, we will definitely face severe sanctions from the international community. (*Analysis at the time was that Xi Jinping was worried about affecting his re-election, but he has been re-elected successfully*)
   
   * **International situation:** Since the CCP established its government, what I have been thinking here is to "liberate Taiwan and reunify the motherland". For so many years, we have not invaded Taiwan by force, but we are afraid of US intervention. Not only the United States, but many countries may intervene in various ways.
   
   * **Pelosi himself and the Biden team have done a risk assessment in advance:** Pelosi set off after they came to the conclusion that "it will not lead to a war in the Taiwan Strait". Biden and Pelosi are both political veterans, and there is little chance of miscalculating the situation.
   
   "In addition, before Pelosi set off, Biden made a special trip to have a phone call with Xi Jinping. The purpose is obviously to do a good job in risk management for both sides."
   Akio Yaita also mentioned that the CCP deliberately chose to start military exercises after Pelosi left the stage. "If it was a day earlier, it would have trapped Pelosi in Taiwan. Why not? Just don't want to make things bigger." As soon as the teacher comes back, he will be honest.”
   
    Yaita wrote that many U.S. warships are waiting near the South China Sea. If China vents a little something, the U.S. can ignore it. "But if it gets bigger, the U.S. will definitely step in. Xi Jinping should know this better than anyone else."

> 矢板明夫分析，因為從中國內政、國際情勢及美中兩國領導人上周才通過電話來看，現階段北京想一手掀起兩岸衝突的機會不大。「這是一場政治表演，其宣傳目的要遠遠大於軍事目的」。「現在的中國人民解放軍不會、也不敢，在台灣海峽挑起戰端。」

> * **內政因素:** 如果在台海發生武力衝突，中國軍隊有可能出師不利，也有可能陷入戰爭泥沼。即使打贏，也一定會面臨來自國際社會的嚴厲制裁。(*當時分析是習近平擔心影響連任，不過他已經連任成功*)

> * **國際情勢:** 中共自建政以來，念茲在茲的就是想要「解放台灣、統一祖國」。這麼多年都沒有武力犯台，就是害怕美國介入。不僅美國，很多國家都可能以各種方式介入。

> * **裴洛西本人和拜登團隊事先都做了風險評估:** 他們得出了「一定不會引發台海戰爭」的結論後，裴洛西才出發的。拜登及裴洛西都是政壇老鳥，同時錯估形勢的可能性不大。

> 「另外，裴洛西出發前，拜登還專程和習近平通了電話，目的很明顯就是做好雙方的風險管控。」
> 矢板明夫也提到，共軍刻意選在裴洛西離台後才開始軍演。「如果提前一天，就可能把裴洛西困在台灣。 > 為什麼不這麼做？就是不想把事情搞大。」「這就像小時候在學校讀書。只要老師一離開，就有壞學生開始調皮搗蛋，等老師一回來，就馬上老實了。」

> 矢板寫道，美軍有多艘艦艇都等在南海附近，若中國搞點小事情發洩一下，美國可以置之不理。「但如果把事情搞大，美國一定會介入。這一點習近平應該比誰都清楚。」

Among the members of the Politburo selected by Xi Jinping, the first focus is on candidates for the development of advanced military technology and capabilities. They have contributed to China's manned space program and the PLA's conventional and nuclear-armed missile programs. On the one hand, it resists pressure from the United States and its allies, and on the other, it aims to retake Taiwan, which Beijing regards as part of Chinese territory.

Of the 24 members of the new Politburo of the Communist Party of China, 15 have more or less some kind of relationship with Taiwan. Some have managed cross-strait economic and trade relations, while others have been tasked with bringing Taiwan to Taiwan when it officially declares independence. recover.

> 習近平挑選的政治局委員中，首先聚焦於發展先進軍事技術和能力的人選。他們曾對中國的太空載人計劃以及解放軍的常規和核武導彈計劃作出過貢獻。一方面抵禦美國及其盟友的壓力，另一方面則著眼於收復被北京視為中國領土一部分的台灣。

在新一屆中共中央政治局24名委員中，有15人與台灣或多或少有過某種關係，有些人管理過兩岸經貿關係，而另一些人則受命在台灣正式宣布獨立時將其收復。

1. Although Taiwan and China have political issues, they still cooperate on non-political issues, and their trade exchanges are also very ordinary. However, mostly in the capacity of civil society.

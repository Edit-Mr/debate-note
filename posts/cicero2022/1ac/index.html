In addition, voluntary enlistment still exists.</p><h2 id=contention-1-military-internal-problems>Contention 1: Military Internal Problems</h2><h3 id=military-strength>Military Strength</h3><p>All soldiers should have patriotism if we want our army to be powerful.

In a 4-month service period, soldiers only receive training for three months, and roughly 25,000 people are in the military each time.

According to the analysis of the Legislative Yuan this year, there were about 153 thousand newborns last year, which is the sixth least in the world. Furthermore, the total number of soldiers will decline to 56 thousand in 2039.</p><h4 id=the-problems-lying-in-current-training>The problems lying in current training</h4><ol><li>For mandatory soldiers, more than the training time is needed.

Next, go to Russia, then China. According to the US government, their military services vary, but most first enlistments are for 3 to 4 years.

Even if we have enough soldiers, our army can only defend itself if we have enough appropriate training. Our training cannot match the actual scenario.

We always say &ldquo;Taiwan number 1&rdquo;. If we want to increase our patriotism, we must make ourselves strong. Furthermore, to increase our strength, we must extend our length of training.

According to the &ldquo;Five-Year Force Reconstruction and Policy Plan Report,2022&rdquo; of the Ministry of National Defense, the Taiwan government bought MQ-9 &ldquo;Reaper&rdquo; from the USA, which can stay in the air for a long time, monitor and detect all day and night, and also has the striking ability. The army, navy, and air force also set up five remote control drone defense systems in the critical barracks. The navy indicates that they had promoted six Kang Ding-class frigate systems to improve the capability to defend air and anti-missile.</p><p>Also, war is no longer a brute force in this age of technology. Learning to operate these devices, such as robots or fighter jets, or making strategic judgments, is less important than physical fitness. No matter your fitness level, there is a place for you in the military. You can contribute any area of your expertise to help the nation.</p><p>Military service is not about making each person a soldier; it is excellent physical and mental training. Military service could help us increase our awareness of protecting our family and country. Also, military service makes soldiers braver, more confident, and more prepared.</p><p>(原本的soft power移到2AC最後面的impact了！)</p></article></main><nav class="end-nav side-padding"><a ontouchstart=cardPressed.call(this) ontouchend=cardReleased.call(this) ontouchmove=cardReleased.call(this) href=https://edit-mr.github.io/notes/posts/cicero2022/1nc/ class="card blog-card bc-next" rel=bookmark><article class=card-body><h2 class=card-title></h2><p class=card-text>1NC 國防部官網
:::info Resolved: That the Taiwanese government should reinstate mandatory one-year military conscription. :::
Good morning honorable judges and distinguished debaters. As the opposing team, the Taiwanese government shouldn’t reinstate mandatory one-year military conscription.
Before I start my debate, I have to admit that Taiwan is facing instability in the Indo-Pacific and a low birthrate. But I think extending military service to one year is a terrible idea, and the situation still has advantages.</p><div class="card-subtext muted-text"><p>Posted <time datetime=0001-01-01>Jan 1, 0001</time></p></div></article></a></nav><footer class=side-padding style=background-image:url(https://edit-mr.github.io/notes/img/home-blob-flip.svg)><a href=https://edit-mr.github.io/notes class=footer-link><img class=footer-icon src=https://edit-mr.github.io/notes/icons/home.svg alt=Home></a>

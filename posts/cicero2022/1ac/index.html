Resolved: The Taiwanese government should reinstate mandatory one-year military conscription.

As the affirmative team, we believed the Taiwanese government should reinstate mandatory one-year military conscription.</p><p>I want to start by ranging the stakeholders. According to the &ldquo;Act of Military Service System,&rdquo; males in Taiwan without disabilities or mental disorders who are eligible for physical examination Aged between 18~36 males should have the duty obligation to receive military service for one year. In addition, volunteering still exists.</p><p>Currently, we are facing these problems:</p><h2 id=contention-1-military-internal-problems>Contention 1: Military Internal Problems</h2><h3 id=military-strength>Military Strength</h3><p>All soldiers should have patriotism if we want our army to be powerful. A report in the <strong>Wall Street Journal on Oct. 2021 indicates</strong> the problem in Taiwan is that the few soldiers and low morale are urgent problems.</p><blockquote><p><a href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/taiwan-military-readiness-china-threat-us-defense-11635174187>https://www.wsj.com/articles/taiwan-military-readiness-china-threat-us-defense-11635174187</a>

In a 4-month service period, soldiers only receive training for three months, and roughly 25,000 people are in the military each time. Compared with those in Korea, 330,000 people each year, the number of soldiers in Taiwan is insufficient.</p><p>One reason is the low birth rate. According to the analysis of the Legislative Yuan this year, there were about 153 thousand newborns last year, which is the sixth least in the world. Furthermore, the total number of soldiers will decline to 56 thousand in 2039.</p><blockquote><p>needs research:用設備反推需求人數</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.ly.gov.tw/Pages/Detail.aspx?nodeid=6590&pid=217246">analyzation from Legislative Yuan</a>

According to <a href=https://www.statista.com/chart/20418/most-powerful-militaries/>statista</a>, the US has the most powerful military force, next goes to Russia, then China. According the US government, their military services varies between services but most first enlistments are for 3 to 4 years. They use at least ten weeks to train basic battle skills. This proves that even strong and powerful countries need to train for a long term.</li><li>Training plans is ineffective.
Even if we have enough soldiers, our army can only defend itself if we have enough appropriate training.
Even if we have enough soldiers, and the training cannot match the real senorio. Genirals, captins, and soidiers and now days nerver have any experience in real war.</li></ol><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nca.gov.tw/chaspx/News_Detail.aspx?web=83&id=6794">內政部義務署</a></p></blockquote><h3 id=actions-speak-louder-than-words>Actions speak louder than words</h3><p>Patriotism should be turned into real action. We always says &ldquo;Taiwan number 1&rdquo;. If we want to increase out patriotism, we must make us strong. And to increase our strength, we must extend our length of training. It doesn&rsquo;t just gain our arm force to prevent crisis and project our home, but also can increasing our patriotism.</p><h4 id=ｅxtending-the-length-of-military-service-can-increase-our-patriotism>Ｅxtending the length of military service can increase our patriotism</h4><p>This phenomenon is similar to &lsquo;Stockholm Syndrome&rsquo;, which was proposed by Kuleshnyk __ in 1984. It happens when people know that it is impossible to escape, their freedom is restricted, and their sources of information are chronically limited. People will start to have recognition and empathy.</p><p>Acturally it&rsquo;s pretty similar to our first day to school. Children cried to go back home at the first day. But over time, children started to adapt and love going to school</p><blockquote><p>發現斯德哥爾摩氏症的心理學家

So we need to keep our arm force in a stable state. But moreover, we can consolidate our soft power. The economic status of Taiwan is vital and indispensable in the world. Take the economic aspect as an example. There is an essential microchips industry in Taiwan, such as TSMC. According to the slide in Earning Calls on Oct. 2022 of TSMC, the net revenue is increasing past two years. Furthermore, according to a report in Business Weekly, Taiwan offers 92% production of advanced microchips and semiconductors around the globe. Under various pressure from China, TSMC has enormous global influence in Taiwan and can serve us with diplomatic and strategic value.

According to The World Bank, since Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine’s economy is now projected to contract by 35% this year although economic activity is scarred by the destruction of productive capacity, damage to agricultural land, and reduced labor supply as more than 14 million people are estimated to have been displaced. According to recent World Bank estimates, recovery and reconstruction needs across social, productive, and infrastructure sectors total at least $349 billion, which is over 1.5 times the size of Ukraine’s pre-war economy in 2021. While global prices for oil, gas and coal have been rising since early 2021, they skyrocketed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This crisis has implications for consumers and Governments alike – constraining fiscal affordability; firm productivity; and household welfare.</p><p><a href=https://www.shihang.org/zh/news/press-release/2022/10/04/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-impedes-post-pandemic-economic-recovery-in-emerging-europe-and-central-asia>https://www.shihang.org/zh/news/press-release/2022/10/04/russian-invasion-of-ukraine-impedes-post-pandemic-economic-recovery-in-emerging-europe-and-central-asia</a></p><h3 id=armed-power>Armed power</h3><p>We can improve the strength of the military. According to the &ldquo;Five-Year Force Reconstruction and Policy Plan Report,2022&rdquo; of the Ministry of National Defense, the Taiwan government bought MQ-9 &ldquo;Reaper&rdquo; from the USA, which can stay in the air for a long time, monitor and detect all day and night, and also has the striking ability. The army, navy, and air force also set up five remote control drone defense systems in the critical barracks. The navy indicates that they had promoted six Kang Ding-class frigate systems to improve the capability to defend air and anti-missile.
Also, war is no longer a brute force in this age of technology. Learning to operate these devices, such as robots or fighter jets; or making strategic judgments, is not any less important than physical fitness. No matter your fitness level, there&rsquo;s a place for you in the military. You can contribute any area of your expertise to help the nation.

Good morning honorable judges and distinguished debaters. As the opposing team, we think that the taiwanese government shouldn’t reinstate mandatory one-year military conscription.
Before I start my debate, I have to admit that Taiwan is facing instability in the Indo-Pacific and the low birthrate.But I think extending military service to one year is a terrible idea. Next, I will show you the downsides of one-year military service and our solutions to the problems that four-month military service creates.</p><div class="card-subtext muted-text"><p>Posted <time datetime=0001-01-01>Jan 1, 0001</time></p></div></article></a></nav><footer class=side-padding style=background-image:url(https://edit-mr.github.io/notes/img/home-blob-flip.svg)><a href=https://edit-mr.github.io/notes class=footer-link><img class=footer-icon src=https://edit-mr.github.io/notes/icons/home.svg alt=Home></a>
